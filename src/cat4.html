              Confidence Levels: Children who can read well are more likely to have higher 
              confidence levels. This will benefit them in school as they’ll feel able to 
              participate fully in activities. Another part of building confidence and 
              self-esteem is knowing where you fit into the world. Stories can help with 
              this process by showing children what people’s lives are like where they live 
              and in other parts of the world.

             <p>Language and Learning: Stories are a great way to introduce new words and ideas into 
                a child’s language – starting with picture books for the very young, working up to 
                more complex novels for teenagers. Stories can help children learn about concepts 
                such as shape, size, space and colour, up and down, inside and outside, numbers and 
                the names of objects. They can also teach children about everyday tasks, such as how 
                to brush their teeth, taking care of animals, cleaning and tidying and preparing food.
                Stories are also useful for teaching more complex ideas, such as the importance of 
                sharing, the passage of time, compassion for others. They can be useful when trying to 
                explain traumatic events, such as family break-ups and bereavement. Fiction based on 
                real-life can also help children with their own life experience – it shows them how 
                diverse the world is and that some people’s lives are vastly different to theirs. And 
                what’s so great about learning through stories is that the process is done in a natural 
                way. There’s no actual teaching involved at all, they learn from simply reading the 
                story. </p>

                Relaxation: Reading stories can be helpful for relaxation, before bedtime for example. 
                They allow children to forget the stresses and strains of the day and indulge in 
                fantasy for a while. The soothing familiarity of a much-loved story, the rhyming and 
                repetition in a picture book, plus the sense of security that time spent reading 
                together can foster, all help the child to relax.

                    Development of Imagination: Stories help to develop a child’s imagination by 
                    introducing new ideas into their world – ideas about fantastical worlds, other 
                    planets, different points in time and invented characters. It’ll encourage the 
                    children to realise that they can, and should, imagine anything they want. The 
                    beauty of stories is that they can be super realistic or incredibly fantastical. 
                    They can be reading about children growing up in exactly the same situation as 
                    them one minute and about another species, Martians holidaying on Jupiter for 
                    example, the next.

                    Coping With Feelings: When children read stories that contain feelings it can 
                    help them understand and accept their own feelings. It helps them understand 
                    that there are other children who feel the same way and they are not alone. 
                    This helps the child understand that feelings are normal and should be expressed. 
                    Watching their responses to the feelings of the characters in the stories will 
                    give you some idea of how a child feels about certain situations and emotions. 
                    For example, how the child responds to the character in the story feeling sad 
                    or scared will give you some idea of how the child thinks.
