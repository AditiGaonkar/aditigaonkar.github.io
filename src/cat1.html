                The endless source of knowledge, information, entertainment, 
                and training are books. Before the age of the internet, books 
                were the most dominating source of knowledge. But of course, 
                with technology, the forms of books have changed, and books 
                have become more accessible to everyone.</h3>

                    Regardless of all other supplements of books, the 
                    contribution and role of books in our life are 
                    indispensable. In the education system, books are 
                    mostly followed to date for knowledge providing and 
                    gain. Books on several subjects enhance several 
                    aspects of education and learning. Writers can
                    express their thoughts, views, and observations 
                    about any topic through their writings, which are 
                    published in books. For general knowledge about 
                    anything, we seek books like encyclopedias, atlas, 
                    and dictionaries. And then there are also those books 
                    that guide us while we are dealing with certain tasks 
                    like cookbooks, travel books, self-help books, etc.

                    All in all, whatever kind of books we choose to read 
                    based on our individual preferences should be for 
                    gaining good knowledge, which will make our life easier
                    and will never harm others in any way. We can read all 
                    types of books and apply the knowledge acquired when we 
                    need it. Among all the information acquired from books, 
                    we tend to remember those which are vital and real to us, 
                    and the pieces of information which are trivial and fake 
                    are lost. Everyone should be encouraged to develop a good 
                    habit of reading books, which will not only help in gaining 
                    knowledge but also help the widening of the imagination 
                    skills of the individual.
