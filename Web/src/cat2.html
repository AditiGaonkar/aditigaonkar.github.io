                That’s right folks the key to happiness is pretty simple, 
                you just need to spend time outside. I’m not saying that

                Studies have found that those who spend more time in nature 
                around forests, parks and other places with plenty of trees 
                experience increased immune function. </p>

             <p>3)You’ll be physically fitter from spending time outdoors: 
                Being outside means you’re more likely to be doing some form 
                of physical activity. Whether it’s kayaking through the 
                incredible Verdon Gorge on holiday in France or even just a 
                gentle 15-minute walk in your local park, it’s exercise that
                most people can do and has many health benefits. From 
                cardiovascular and joint stimulation to a full-on workout. 
                Depending on your ability pick an activity that suits your 
                pace or challenge yourself bit-by-bit and watch your fitness 
                improve. </p> </h3>

             <p>4)Being exposed to sunlight is good for you too: 
                The sun does so much for this planet and so much for you also. 
                When sunlight touches your skin it initiates a process which 
                activates vitamin D which benefits your body in heeps of ways. </p>

             <p>5)Spending time in nature will help to make you less stressed and depressed: 
                In a world overcome with worries and distractions taking the 
                time to get outside can help relieve some of those daily stresses. 
                Getting into the great outdoors has a calming effect on our minds 
                even if it’s just for a little bit each day. When you’re outside if 
                you go for a hike or a run it’s even better. This gets your blood 
                flowing and heart pumping which lowers stress levels. </p>

             <p>6)Being in nature can be a spiritual practice: 
                A long walk in nature can have a very therapeutic effect whilst 
                helping you to feel present in the moment. Plus, being in nature 
                produces brain waves similar to those you experience when meditating. 
                For a long time, people have believed that nature has been able to 
                teach valuable lessons and reveal metaphors to help us connect with 
                our spirituality. The changing seasons have often been likened to 
                reflecting the peaks and valleys of life. As well as gushing rivers 
                which are a reminder to “go with the flow”. </p>

             <p>7)The more time you spend outside the better you’ll sleep: 
                Spending time in nature means you’ll be exposed to natural light 
                which aids our bodies to regulate our sleep patterns. As the night 
                draws in our brains will release the right levels of melatonin 
                which helps you to get a good night’s sleep. </p>

             <p>8)Spending time in nature improves your memory: 
                If you occasionally walk into a room and forget why you went in, 
                this one is for you. Just the occasional walk in nature could 
                help improve your memory, up to a whopping 20% according to 
                The University of Michigan. </p>
